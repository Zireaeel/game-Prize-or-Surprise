# game-Prize-or-Surprise
game-Prize-or-Surprise is a game of chance created by Zireaeel using a Python Pygame module. The game was inspired by popular games like "Deal or No Deal" and has been developed further from that concept. Although the project is a licensed product, you are free to use it as you wish.
* It is written with the help of the Pygame, Time, and Random modules.
* All files containing the code are ".py" files.
* The "data" folder includes the Grand9K Pixel font (.ttf) that I used.
* The "images" folder is divided into 4 separate subfolders, each containing in-game images (.img) used during gameplay.
* The "music" folder contains background music or sound effects used during the game.

## How Does It Work?
    You need to create a folder and place the files I provided into it. Make sure all files and folders are within the same directory.

# Why Is It Not Working?
* Ensure that Pygame is installed on your computer. If not, you can install it by typing "pip install pygame" in the command prompt or terminal in VSCode.
* Make sure that the folders and files are organized correctly as instructed.
